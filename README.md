# GitHub Test Scripts
This is a sample repo used to test out the basic git processes as well as test configuring IDE integrations with github.  This repo lives on Github in a Github organization called seawsstest.  The organization is free so all repos created in it are public. **Please do not add sensitive code to any repos created in this org**


# Getting Started
To work with the GitHub repo, you can download GitHub Desktop here: https://desktop.github.com/.  GitHub Desktop has a built in interactive tutorial...complete with a sample repo... that you can walk through to learn the basics of git.

To work with the code in the GitHub repo, you can use Visual Studio, Code or the PowershellISE. There are Git plugins for VS and Code, configuring the PowershellISE for interactivity with Git is coming soon.  If you want to configure git push/pull in the PowershellISE yourself, see the following link:  https://gripdev.wordpress.com/2015/01/23/powergist-source-control-for-powershell-ise-with-github-gists/

# Roadmap
Right now this is just a collection of test scripts.  For production, after we choose a hosting platform, we will need to determine how we want to organize our, well organization.  How do we want to organize our scripts?  Do we want to add a separate repo for documentation or include documentation with scripts.  Do we want a repo for SEAWSS process documentation?
