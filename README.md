# GitHub Test Scripts
This is a sample repo used to test out the basic git processes as well as test configuring IDE integrations with github.  This repo lives on github
Feel free to add information below

# Getting Started
To work with the GitHub repo, you can download GitHub Desktop here: https://desktop.github.com/.  GitHub Desktop has a built in interactive tutorial...complete with a sample repo... that you can walk through to learn the basics of git.

To work with the code in the GitHub repo, you can use Visual Studio, Code or the PowershellISE. There are Git plugins for VS and Code, configuring the PowershellISE for interactivity with Git is coming soon.  If you want to configure git push/pull in the PowershellISE yourself, see the following link:  https://gripdev.wordpress.com/2015/01/23/powergist-source-control-for-powershell-ise-with-github-gists/
